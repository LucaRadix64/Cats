Compared to the other X-linked Gene FOXP3, the SLC25A6 Gene resulted in a slightly less destinct tree. This indicates that the SLC25A6 is likely more conserved which resulted in less variations. The autosome variants were a bit worse and the mitochondrial genes ND2 and CYTB were the best for phylogenic trees. This is because the mitochondrial genome does not have crossing over which reduces the amount of variants. 
Due to all the phylogenic trees being separated a conclusion on which gene gives the most realistic tree is not possible. The best result could be gained from a tree with the combined data from all observed genes. However, such Research has already been done: „In two separate studies that examined morphological, ethological, and physiological features, Hemmer indicated that Panthera appeared to divide into two distinct clades (Hemmer, 1974, Hemmer, 1981). According to his studies, lions, leopards and jaguars share a specific set of common characters that distinguishes them from the second large cat clade containing the tiger. These results support the reciprocal monophyly of the lion–leopard–jaguar and tiger–snow leopard clades observed in our genetic results, a topology also supported by mitochondrial RFLP analysis (Johnson et al., 1996), as well as an analysis of excretory chemical signals (Bininda-Emonds et al., 2001).“ (Davis, Brian W., Gang Li, and William J. Murphy. "Supermatrix and species tree methods resolve phylogenetic relationships within the big cats, Panthera (Carnivora: Felidae)." Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 56.1 (2010): 64-76.)
